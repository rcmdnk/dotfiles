# Global Agent Configuration

## Time stamp
Show time stamp by using `date` command at the start and end of each session to track how long it takes for each agent to complete its tasks.
Show time stamp at the start and end of each agent's response to track how long it takes for each agent to complete its tasks.

## Git repository

### Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write commit messages by English.
- Write commit subjects in the imperative mood with concise scopes (e.g., `feat: add pane drag overlay`). Scopes are:
  - feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
  - fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
  - docs: (changes to the documentation)
  - style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
  - refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
  - test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
  - chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- Group related changes together and avoid mixing formatting with feature work.
- When commits are warranted, proceed without waiting for explicit approval; communicate intent briefly when doing so.
- Describe user-facing impact in pull requests, referencing issue numbers when applicable.

### Using pre-commit/prek
- If your project uses Git for version control, commit your changes to a Git repository after making changes.
- If pre-commit/prek is installed in your environment, it will automatically run checks on your code before committing.
- If pre-commit/prek fails, address the issues it raises before attempting to commit again.

### Use gh to check GitHub status

- Use the `gh` command-line tool to check the status of your GitHub repository, including open pull requests and issues.

## context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context. Codex CLI hooks provide runtime enforcement when `[features].hooks = true`; these instructions remain mandatory model-side enforcement. Follow strictly.

### Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

### BLOCKED — do NOT use

#### curl / wget — FORBIDDEN
Do NOT use `curl`/`wget` in shell. Dumps raw HTTP into context.
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

#### Inline HTTP — FORBIDDEN
No `node -e "fetch(..."`, `python -c "requests.get(..."`. Bypasses sandbox.
Use: `ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

#### Direct web fetching — FORBIDDEN
Raw HTML can exceed 100 KB.
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)`

### REDIRECTED — use sandbox

#### Shell (>20 lines output)
Shell ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "...")`. Use `language: "shell"` only when code matches the host shell.

#### File reading (for analysis)
Reading to **edit** → reading correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

#### grep / search (large results)
Use `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "...")` in sandbox for portable filtering/counting.

### Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

### Parallel I/O batches

For multi-URL fetches or multi-API calls, **always** include `concurrency: N` (1-8):

- `ctx_batch_execute(commands: [3+ network commands], concurrency: 5)` — gh, curl, dig, docker inspect, multi-region cloud queries
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(requests: [{url, source}, ...], concurrency: 5)` — multi-URL batch fetch

**Use concurrency 4-8** for I/O-bound work (network calls, API queries). **Keep concurrency 1** for CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or commands sharing state (ports, lock files, same-repo writes).

GitHub API rate-limit: cap at 4 for `gh` calls.

### Output

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `ctx_search(source: "label")`.

### Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

### Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What were we working on? | `ctx_search(queries: ["summary"], source: "compaction", sort: "timeline")` |
| What did we decide? | `ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What NOT to repeat? | `ctx_search(queries: ["rejected"], source: "rejected-approach")` |
| What constraints exist? | `ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

Note: user-prompt history not available.

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

### ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.

### Windows notes

**PowerShell cmdlets** — Sandbox uses bash. PowerShell cmdlets (`Format-List`, `Get-Culture`, etc.) fail with `command not found`. Wrap with `pwsh -NoProfile -Command "..."`.

**Relative paths** — Sandbox CWD is temp dir, not project root. Convert to absolute paths. Ask user to confirm if unknown.

**Windows drive letters** — Sandbox runs Git Bash / MSYS2. `X:\path` → `/x/path` (lowercase, no `/mnt/`). Never emit `/mnt/<letter>/`.

**Quote paths** — Spaces in paths cause splits. Always double-quote: `rg "symbol" "$REPO_ROOT/some dir/Source"`.
