## MCP Servers

### mcp-server-git
- Use mcp-server-git when you need to perform Git operations in a controlled environment.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write commit subjects in the imperative mood with concise scopes (e.g., `feat: add pane drag overlay`).
- Group related changes together and avoid mixing formatting with feature work.
- When commits are warranted, proceed without waiting for explicit approval; communicate intent briefly when doing so.
- Describe user-facing impact in pull requests, referencing issue numbers when applicable.
