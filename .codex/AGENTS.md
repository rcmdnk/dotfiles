## Git repository

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write commit subjects in the imperative mood with concise scopes (e.g., `feat: add pane drag overlay`).
- Group related changes together and avoid mixing formatting with feature work.
- When commits are warranted, proceed without waiting for explicit approval; communicate intent briefly when doing so.
- Describe user-facing impact in pull requests, referencing issue numbers when applicable.

## Using pre-commit
- If your project uses Git for version control, commit your changes to a Git repository after making changes.
- If pre-commit is installed in your environment, it will automatically run checks on your code before committing.
- If pre-commit fails, address the issues it raises before attempting to commit again.
